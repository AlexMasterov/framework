# Spark
A tiny and powerful PHP micro-framework. Attempts to be [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/),
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) and
[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) compliant. Also uses the [ADR](https://github.com/pmjones/adr)
pattern. You should too!

A sample project exists at [sparkphp/Project](https://github.com/sparkphp/Project). This shows the best
way to use this framework, and is a quick way to start a new project.
